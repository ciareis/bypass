 # Bypass for PHP

For documentation in Portguese: [click here
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·](https://github.com/ciareis/bypass/blob/main/README_pt-BR.md)

`Bypass` for PHP provides a quick way to create a custom instead of an actual HTTP server to return prebaked responses to client requests. This is most useful in tests, when you want to create a mock HTTP server and test how your HTTP client handles different types of responses from the server.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0

## Install

To install via composer, run:

```bash
composer require --dev ciareis/bypass
```

## Getting started

### Use case

For demo purpose:

1. Imagine you have a service `TotalScoreService` and you must write a test for it.
2. This service calculates the total game score of a specific username.
3. To get the score, it consumes the fictitious API at `emtudo-games.com/v1/score/::USERNAME::` 
4. The API returns status `200`and a JSON body with a list of games:

```json
{
  "games": [
    {
      "name": "game 1",
      "points": 25
    },
    {
      "name": "game 2",
      "points": 10
    }
  ],
  "is_active": true
}
```

Let's test it with Bypass.

### 1. Start by opening a Bypass server

Bypass will always run at `http://localhost`. To open a server use:

```php
$bypass = Bypass::open();
```

By default, Bypass will be listening to a random port number. 
If needed, a specific port can be passed as an argument:

```php
// opens Bypass in port 8080
$bypass = Bypass::open(8080);
```

### 2. Bypass URL & Port

The URL with Port can be retrieved with the method `getBaseUrl()`:

 ```php
 $bypass_url = $bypass->getBaseUrl(); //for example: http://localhost:16819
 ```
 
If you need to retrieve only the port number, use the method `getPort()`:

 ```php
 $bypass_port = $bypass->getPort(); //for example: 16819
 ```

### 3. Add a route

Now, let's create a route to be accessed by the `TotalScoreService` service using the following options:

- **Method**: the request will be made using the HTTP method `get`
- **URI**: the request will be at the URI `/v1/score/USERNAME` 
- **Status number** `200` (OK success) 
- **Body**: a text body (JSON encoded).

And the code will like this:

```php
//The body containing the API response with games in JSON format
$body = '{"games":[{"name":"game 1","points":25},{"name":"game 2","points":10}],"is_active":true}';

//Bypass route 
$bypass->addRoute(method: 'get', uri: '/v1/score', status: 200, body: $body);
```

The method `addRoute()` accepts the following parameters:

| Option | Description
|----|----|
|**HTTP Method**| *(string) $method* - Method to expect. (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) |
|**URI**| *(string) $uri* - URI to be served by Bypass |
|**Status**| *(int) $status* - Status to be returned by Bypass (default: 200)|
|**Body**|  *(string) $body*  - body that will be served (optional)|
|**Times**|  * (int) $time*  - Define times route is called (default: 1) |


The method `addRouteFile()` accepts the following parameters:

| Option | Description
|----|----|
|**HTTP Method**| *(string) $method* - Method to expect. (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) |
|**URI**| *(string) $uri* - URI to be served by Bypass |
|**Status**| *(int) $status* - Status to be returned by Bypass (default: 200)|
|**File**|  * (binary) $file*  - binary file |
|**Times**|  * (int) $time*  - Define times route is called (default: 1) |

The method `assertRoute()` returns an exception if the defined routes are not called for the expected number of times.


### 4. Use the service with the Bypass URL

At this point, you can tell `TotalScoreService` to access the Bypass URL (`localhost:16819/v1/score`) instead of the original URL (`emtudo-games.com/v1/score/`):

```php
$bypass = Bypass::open();
$bypass_url = $bypass->getBaseUrl();


$service = new TotalScoreService();
$response = $service
  ->setBaseUrl($bypass_url) //set the URL to Bypass url
  ->getTotalScoreByUsername("johndoe"); //returns 35
```

### 5. Stop or shutdown

Bypass can be stopped or shutdown with the following methods:

To stop:
`$bypass->stop();`

To shutdown:
`$bypass->down();`

```php

  //prepare
  $bypass = Bypass::open();

  $body = '{"games":[{"name":"game 1","points":25},{"name":"game 2","points":10}],"is_active":true}';
  
  $bypass->addRoute(method: 'get', uri: '/v1/score', status: 200, body: $body);
  
  $service = new TotalScoreService();
  $response = $service
    ->setBaseUrl($bypass->getBaseUrl())
    ->getTotalScoreByUsername("johndoe");

  expect($response)->toEqual(35);
});
```

    $response = $service
      ->setBaseUrl($bypass->getBaseUrl())
      ->getTotalScoreByUsername("johndoe");

    $this->assertSame(35, $response);
  }
}
